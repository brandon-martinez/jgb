# LFEV 2015 CAN Communications Microprocessor #
This software is written for a CAN 2.0 communications board. The is a microcontroller was designed to interface all low level analog and digital sensors present on the 2015 LFEV with the main Data Acquisition Computer (SCADA). The software is capable of handling both reading and writing data.  

## Target Device ##
This software is written for the **Atmel ATMEGA 16M1 Automotive AVR**  
  
This device was selected for its price, software availability, documentation and onboard CAN bus support.
